# JSONObject

A test task where I work with JSON-simple library.

## Launch

you can clone the project on your machine and launch the program with your preferred IDE.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:bluMitsu/JSONObject.git 
```
## Task 
Write a java program that will read the tickets.json file and calculate:
- average flight time between Vladivostok and Tel Aviv
- 90th percentile of flight time between Vladivostok and Tel Aviv
## Result
Assuming that the file doesn't contain other countries this is the result I get for the given file.

>Note: I have rewritten the tickets.json file to remove the BOM symbol as it was causing issues when being parsed.
